PARSEC's way of doing things:
make distclean
./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/BIN-BODYTRACK
    e.g. /home/asit/AC-workdir/PARSEC-versions/parsec-2.1/pkgs/apps/bodytrack/BIN-BODYTRACK
make
make install

To run the binary:
Go into BIN-BODYTRACK/bin/
./bodytrack ../../inputs/sequenceB_4 4 4 4000 5 0 1

see ./bodytrack for more help
Output files are placed in the same folder as the input files


NEW Way of building the binary with pragmas embedded in binary:

make distclean
./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/BIN-BODYTRACK
    e.g. 
./configure --prefix=/home/asit/AC-workdir/AxC-SVN-SHARED-REPO/axc/workloads/bodytrack-PARSEC/BIN CC=clang CXX=clang++
./configure --prefix=/home/asit/AC-workdir/AxC-SVN-SHARED-REPO/axc/workloads/bodytrack-PARSEC/BIN

./build_script.sh

To run the binary:
Go into BIN-BODYTRACK/bin/
./bodytrack ../../inputs/sequenceB_4 4 4 4000 5 0 1

see ./bodytrack for more help
Output files are placed in the same folder as the input files
